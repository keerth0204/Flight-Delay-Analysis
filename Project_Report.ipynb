These circumstances are usually in the form of weather delays, security delays, carrier delays, late arrival delays, etc. Flights must try to minimize delays as this aspect directly converts to flier experience which in turn affects brand image and sales. As a result, we hypothesize that flight delays will have a visible effect on carrier stocks which we hope to capture through stock data from 2018-20. In this project, we seek to draw parallels to different factors affecting delay behavior, analyze seasonal trends, and answer our questions of interest: <br/>\n","\n","**1) Are there seasonal trends to flights and flight delays?** <br/>\n","**2) What is the relationship between delays and location?** <br/>\n","**3) What is the relationship between delays and carriers?** <br/>\n","**4) Is there a pattern to flight delays?** <br/>\n","**5) Do airline carriers experience a stock drop after a delay or a certain amount of delays?** <br/>\n","\n","These questions are valuable in answering not only the consumer implications of booking a flight with certain airlines at certain locations, but also the resulting market implications for airline carriers as a result of delayed service.  \n","\n","#### Dataset Description \n","To conduct this analysis, our group utilized seven datasets. <br/>\n","The first dataset that we used was sourced from Kaggle. This dataset contained flight data from the United States between the years of 2018-2020, the delay circumstances listed included carrier delays, weather delays, security delays, late aircraft delays, and national air service delays. The initial dataset contained up to 28 columns and 3 million rows per year prior to filtering. As we will walk through in our processing portion, this dataset was filtered down to only contain the top five carriers in terms of flights.<br/>\n","The second dataset we used was sourced from datahub.io which contained airport location data. This dataset was used in order to determine where the airports were located in terms of longitude and latitude. Before processing, this dataset contained 12 columns and 57,421 rows. <br/>\n","Finally, the last five datasets were stock data from 2018-2020 sourced from Yahoo Finance. The data gathered from this dataset was used in this report to determine the impact of delays on carrier valuation. Each dataset contained 5 columns and 755 rows.\n","\n","#### Analysis Focus\n","While a fair amount of processing was done in order to cleanse the data to prepare it for our analysis, our report is ultimately focused on using our data in order to provide greater insights to airline customers and companies about the impact of flight delays. Not only did we conduct exploratory analysis to determine whether were patterns, but we dug deeper and sought to understand the correlations and the impact of one event on the other. In this report, each visualization will be accompanied by additional analyses and inferences in an attempt to determine why those patterns occur.

Carrier delays happen because there has been a mismanagement of events within the control of the carrier. These events include fueling, flight clean-up, baggage mishap amongst others.\n","\n","It is the carrier's lack of insight if they were not prepared for a full house and hence failed to accomodate the time it takes for flyers to check-in, clear security checks, etc. While Airline business operations strive to be as streamlined as possible while interacting with passengers, handling passenger baggage, managing their ground staff and pilots, working in partnership with other carriers to facilitate connecting flights will always be a challenge. Companies need to cooperate and communicate to reduce information gaps and in turn bring down the number of delayed flights. Delays caused by one flight has a cascading effect on connecting flights. It is not profitable, nor does it build good customer relations, if flights were to take off on time without a bulk of their passengers who come from delayed connectings flights. \n","\n","Furthermore, Most Air Carrier delays are from airports in or around metropolitan cities. For example, ORD (O'Hare International Airport) from Chicago, ATL, DFW, and DEN are all located near metropolitan cities in the United states. Meaning, more people are travelling in the States from airports near metropolitan cities perhaps due to the concentration of businesses or, rather, people are well-off in these areas and prefer to use flights over any other means of transport.\n","\n","Surprisingly, weather delays have nowhere near the numbers of the two delays discussed above. A quick google search tells how only 4% of the flights experience extreme weather delays (Bureau of Transportation Statistics). While NAS delays make up for 24% of all delays (Sheffield). Since NAS delays primarily concern operations of an airport, air traffic control, and traffic volume, most of these delays can be eliminated with better planning and perhaps with the introduction of digitization of their internal processes. With humans in-charge of operating and resolving/ caliberating flight routes and traffic, there are bound to be mishaps that lead to delays. \n","\n","Delays due to security reasons seem insignificant compared to the other delays. This could be attributed to the fact that most travellers are seasoned flyers at this age and time. And even if one isn't, they have numerous sources bombarding them with information regarding the protocols of safe flying. Furthermore, there are machines that make finding items not allowed onboard quicker. Most travellers are time-bound, goal-oriented, and hence make sure to ensure safe passage through to their destinations by following safetly rules and regulations.

We inferred that this was because Spring has temperate weather and because there is Spring break around this time. We also inferred, after looking closer at the data, that this was likely due to Covid-19 restrictions in 2020 which made Summer travel harder to do than it used to be in 2018 and 2019. Our initial hypothesis was confirmed when looking at the spread of delays by season, as Winter took the lead. However, it was not for the reason we expected, as weather made up a very small percentage of the total delays. Consistently, thoughout all the seasons, late aircraft delay accounted for the most significant percentage of delays which is most likely due to its all-encompassing nature for all late aircraft. \n","\n","Similarly, from both the location and airport end, late aircraft delay accounted for the majority of airline delays. While we know that late aircrafts are the major cause of delays within our dataset, it is hard to truly interpret the actionable solutions, as the culpability of late aircrafts can lie within other delays that preceeded the one labelled \"late aircraft delay\". Furthermore, aside from \"late aircraft delay\" and \"security delay\", the spread of delays amongst each carrier and location is fairly varied, so even by looking at the second most frequent delay for each category, the solutions vary. However, when analyzing each respective location and carrier alone, we can better determine the factors affecting each category and seek improvements.\n","\n","From the additional analysis done on the average delay of carriers, it was determined that SkyWest had the most reliability in terms of least average delays over the years 2018-2020, followed by Southwest, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and finally United Airlines. \n","\n","In terms of trends over time, there was a clear impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on flight delays. Outside of the number of cancelled flights increasing at this time due to health concerns, the number of delays also grew significantly. We attributed this increase to growing safety measures as a result of the pandemic taking more time to perform. \n","\n","From the previous conclusions, the evidence for the butterfly effect resulting from one flight delay to the next became more and more prevalent, leading to a more thorough investigation into the relationship between arrival and departure delays. By investigating which flights' early, on-time, and late departure times affected flights' early, on-time, and late arrival times, there was a clear correlation that accounted for 78% percent of all flights which signified that flights that left late, arrived late. The correlations between early and delayed and on-time and delayed were much weaker, with on-time still having a higher percentage of delays than early departures by 7%.\n","\n","The effect of flight delays on stocks was not significant until the beginning of the knowledge of Covid-19, due the daily flight delays not being excessively long on average. However, we can conclude that in the covid era, which began on January 1, 2020, trading is being done on the sentiment of flight delays.\n","\n","Through our report, we were able to analyze the trend and spread of delays through time, by carrier, and by location. In it we were able to document how Covid-19 affected many of the normal happenings of flights and even reoriented the investor sentiment to caring about flight delays per carrier. While many of us are disgruntled at the airline carriers themselves when our flights get delayed, this analysis displays that, transportation is often subject to unforeseen circumstances despite individual best practices of players within the industry to ensure the safety of its passengers. This analysis sets the groundwork for further research and analysis into the main causes of late aircraft delays for each aircraft for each carrier. The findings from this project can be further used to determine the sensitivity of other transportation services from 2018-2020 and the sensitivity of their stocks to the delays caused by the pandemic.
